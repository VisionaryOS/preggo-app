# Deployment Checklist

## Problematic Features Removed

1. ✅ Simplified the `CompleteStep.tsx` component:
   - Removed complex TypeScript typing
   - Removed database interactions with Supabase
   - Removed animation dependencies
   - Created a basic functional version with minimal TypeScript

2. ✅ Updated build configuration:
   - Removed TypeScript ignore flag from package.json build script
   - Simplified vercel.json to minimal configuration

3. ✅ Simplified the main page:
   - Created a minimal landing page with basic styling
   - Removed complex animations and dependencies

4. ✅ Environment variables:
   - Created placeholder empty variables to prevent missing env errors

## Deployment Instructions

1. Log in to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Create a new project and import this repository
3. Set up the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (if needed)
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (if needed)
4. Deploy the project

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check the build logs for:
- TypeScript errors
- Missing dependencies
- Environment variable issues

Consider further simplifying components or features until deployment succeeds, then gradually add features back one by one.

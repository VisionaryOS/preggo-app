# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the MomCare application to improve efficiency and maintainability while preserving functionality.

## 1. Authentication Optimizations

### Improved useAuth Hook
- **Selective State Subscription**: The authentication state is now managed with individual selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Atomic State Updates**: State updates are now performed atomically to reduce render cycles
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling for authentication operations

## 2. Data Fetching Optimizations

### TanStack Query Integration
- **Stale-While-Revalidate Pattern**: Implemented React Query for efficient data fetching with proper caching
- **Optimistic Updates**: User profile updates now use optimistic UI updates for a more responsive experience
- **Automatic Retries**: Added automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Query Invalidation**: Proper cache invalidation strategy to ensure data freshness

## 3. Component Optimizations

### Memoization
- **React.memo**: Static components are now wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Component Splitting**: Dashboard page components have been split into smaller, more focused components
- **Props Optimization**: Only necessary props are passed to child components

## 4. Supabase Client Enhancements

### Resilient Connection Handling
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff for database connections
- **Error Recovery**: Improved error handling and recovery for database operations
- **Connection Testing**: Enhanced connection testing utilities

## 5. Performance Monitoring

### Web Vitals Tracking
- **Core Web Vitals**: Added tracking for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, etc.)
- **Performance Logging**: Implemented logging of performance metrics for analysis
- **Analytics Integration**: Prepared infrastructure for sending metrics to analytics services

## 6. Bundle Size Optimization

### Code Splitting
- **Dynamic Imports**: Set up dynamic imports for components that aren't needed immediately
- **Route-Based Code Splitting**: Each route now only loads the JavaScript it needs

## Future Improvements

1. **Image Optimization**: Implement Next.js Image component for all images
2. **Server Components**: Convert more components to React Server Components where appropriate
3. **Prefetching Data**: Implement prefetching for common user journeys
4. **Service Worker**: Add a service worker for offline capabilities and asset caching
5. **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Optimize for the upcoming INP Core Web Vital

## Performance Testing

### Before Optimization
- Initial load time: TBD
- Time to Interactive: TBD
- Bundle size: TBD

### After Optimization
- Initial load time: TBD
- Time to Interactive: TBD
- Bundle size: TBD
